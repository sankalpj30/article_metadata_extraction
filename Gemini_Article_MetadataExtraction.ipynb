            "**Abstract:** Background: Drug administration through feeding tubes presents many challenges to the healthcare provider. There is little information available on medications than can be delivered safely when crushed and what efforts can be implemented to minimize clogging the feeding tube. Our institution requested a comprehensive examination of all oral medications for the feeding tube route. Materials and Methods: This report is a synopsis of the physical evaluation of 323 different oral medications for their appropriateness for feeding tube administration with distal site in either the stomach or jejunum. A worksheet was created for each medication. This document contained a review of the chemical and physical properties which would contribute to delivery of the medication. Each medication was then studied for the degree of disintegration, pH, osmolality, and potential to form clogs. For drugs which needed to be crushed, the volume of water needed to dissolve the drug, time for that process and volume needed to rinse the tube after administration was also studied. Results: The results of this review are summarized in a table based on a composite of the documents cited, tests conducted, and author's judgements based all the data collected. 36 medications were identified as inappropriate for feeding tube administration and an additional 46 medications were identified as inappropriate for direct jejunal administration Conclusion: The information produced by this study will enable clinicians to make informed choices in selecting, compounding, and rinsing medications through feeding tubes. Using the template provided, they will be able to evaluate a drug not studied here for potential issues in feeding tube administration.\n",
